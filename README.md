# DomsGroup

DomsGroup is a social media app based on a tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1mdAPFq2Os).

I built this to practice using GIT, the MERNG stack and not least to add a little bit to my dictionary of projects I can pull from in the future if I need a reference.

The finished app is published here: https://stupefied-galileo-5627c2.netlify.app/
The client is deployed on Netlify and the server is deployed on Heroku.
